# WebGL Cube Rotation

This repository contains a WebGL implementation for rendering a rotating cube like polygon, or an incomplete cube that has two sides. The code demonstrates key concepts in WebGL programming, including shader compilation, matrix transformations, and animation techniques.

## Getting Started

To run the code, you'll need a modern web browser with WebGL support. Follow these steps:
1. Clone this Repo to your local machine : `git clone https://github.com/Ivyson/Test-2CG-Test.git && cd Test-2CG-Test`
2. If you intend to modify or contribute in anyway to this code you can fork this repo and contribute, however for personal use you can execute `code .` after entering the command on step 1.(that is if you are using vscode)

## Code Usage

The provided code serves as a starting point for learning 3D graphics programming and WEBGL as a concept. You can modify and expand on this code to create more complex scenes and animations.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the canvas element and script tags for WebGL setup.
- `script.js`: JavaScript code for WebGL initialization, shader compilation, matrix operations, and cube animation.


## Debugging

If you encounter any issues or errors, you can check the browser console for debugging information. The console logs shader compilation details and projection matrix values for debugging purposes. For any enquiries you can just contact me through my github account @`Ivyson` or email at brandonrohrer@telegmail.com
